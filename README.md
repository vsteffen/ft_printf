# ft_printf
42 School project. From the subject (also available in french):

> The versatility of the printf function in C represents a great exercise in programming for us. This project is of moderate difficulty. It will enable you to discover variadic functions in C in a particularly relevant context as well as learn about a great example of a basic “dispatcher” in C via the use of an array of function’s pointers.

> The key to a successful ft_printf is a well-structured and good extensible code. This is because as time goes by, you will be more and more tempted to continue to extend your ft_printf, making your life easier for your future projects. So take your time to code properly while keeping in mind that you will have to read again your code in a few weeks or a few months to extend its functionality according to your needs. It would be a shame not to being able to do it because you can’t read your own work. What do you think?
